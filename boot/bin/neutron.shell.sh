# -------------------------------------
# Neutron Shell Script for Microkernel
# -------------------------------------
#
# The `neutron-shell` program is the main user-space shell executed by the microkernel
# after it has booted and initialized system services. Its primary purpose is to provide
# an interactive interface for the user and facilitate additional setup tasks or debugging.
# This file is crucial for interacting with the system after boot.
#
# Warning
# -------------------------------------
# CRUCIAL FILE: If `neutron-shell` is missing, incorrectly configured, or fails to execute,
# the system will not enter an interactive mode, severely limiting functionality. Ensure this
# script is properly configured and executable within the appropriate environment.
#
# -------------------------------------
